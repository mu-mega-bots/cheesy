# Why we don't delete user ids
We use your user id to see which image you upload. We use this data to block you from the service if you happen to break any of our rules and we deem it necessary to block you. This is recorded in our logs and kept on the machine.

# Rules
- Cheese Images and Gifs only (keep it meme content as much as you can)
Anything else will be deleted.
